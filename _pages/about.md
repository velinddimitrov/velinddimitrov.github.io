I'm a roboticist with a deep focus on electrical engineering, embedded systems, and research hardware. My work sits at the intersection of foundational research and real-world deployment, translating ideas into robust proof-of-concept systems demonstrating state-of-the-art dynamic robot behaviors.

Currently, I'm an Electrical Engineering Manager at the Robotics and AI Institute in Cambridge, MA, where I support multiple research programs spanning embedded firmware, power distribution, sensing, and actuation. I lead and mentor teams of full-time engineers and co-ops, define electrical/embedded architectures, and partner closely with other teams to align hardware development with program-level objectives.

Engineering Philosophy
---

I approach engineering with a holistic, broad system mindset. I believe great hardware is not just about mechanical and electrical engineering. It’s about coordination and teamworking aimed at balancing technical risks and tradeoffs based on the team's insights into what matters most. Whether I’m moderating a group to define common interface standards, reviewing designs, or bolting together prototypes, my goal is to enable rapid iteration to answer the questions at hand quickly and safely.

A significant part of my work has involved establishing building blocks and formalizing procedures that empowering research scientists to be self-sufficient and safely accelerate their research. I take pride in helping build thoughtful, capable, and curious teams that tackle challenges, technical or cultural, with principled fearlessness.

Background & Experience
---

My background spans roles in humanoids, autonomous vehicles, and UGV rovers where I’ve owned system-level electrical design and cross-functional integration from concept through deployment. Highlights include:

* Designing and deploying sensing, compute, and actuation architectures for robots

* Leading cross-functional efforts across hardware, firmware, and software teams

* Driving university–industry collaborations on assistive robotics and novel human–machine interfaces

* Defining technical strategy based executive leadership and external stakeholder initiatives

Across these roles, I’ve consistently worked in environments where ambiguity is the norm and engineering judgment matters.

What I’m Interested In
---

* Dynamic robots that interact gracefully with the physical environment, especially in the sphere of assistive robotics

* Embedded and firmware-driven systems that flexibily accomodate future needs

* Power electronics and bleeding-edge battery technologies

* Prototype processes and engineering standards that maintain safety but accelerate development

* Advocacy, mentorship, and technical leadership

Outside of Work

When not building cool robots at work, I enjoy traveling the world with my wife, learning about different cultures, and trying all the unique local cuisines. Traveling gives us a deep appreciation for what brings people together and what makes different cultures unique around the world.

At home, I enjoy cooking where I aim to recreate our favorite flavors from our travels. Through a combination of experimentation and YouTube guides, we sometimes recreate the flavor and sometimes accidentally create new ones ... for better or worse!
